What was discussed:
	Poster work
	Motion planning methods (How the eel/oscellation works and what the benefits are)
	"mock" demo next week
	Path-planning algorithm (work backwards from the working implementation)
What as accomplished:
	Created a tutorial for the ACM-R5 robot
	Implemented a conservative algorithm for planning
	Updated repo with current work
	Goal navigation was also achieved in a non-standard format
Actions needed to be taken: 
	Keep working on motion planning methods, focus on eel
	"mock" demo next week preperation (videos etc)
	Poster work
	Work on getting the path-planning algorithm working
