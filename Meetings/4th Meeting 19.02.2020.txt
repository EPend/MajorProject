What was discussed:
	How the ACM-R5 robot works and what it gives you
	How Coppelia achieved their "water-like" scene
	Creating a small motion planning algorithm to conservatively navigate towards a goal
What as accomplished:
	Created a testing scene
	Explored how scripts were written in Coppelia
	Learnt about B0-resolver and how to write C++ scripts for Coppelia
	Somewhat learnt how the control scripts for ACM-R5 robot works
Actions needed to be taken: 
	Create a tutorial for understanding the control script
	Implement a conservative motion planning algorithm
	Explore oscillating motion and other control methods for the ACM-R5 robot
