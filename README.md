# Motion Planning for a Space Robotics System
This repository contains all files relevant to my major project.
[Trello board (PRIVATE)](https://trello.com/b/Zzh4CBKQ/)
## Files
The files in this project are split up into 3 sections:

 - Coppelia scene and related files (contains the robot, scene and lua scripts)
 - Visual studio project which as of writing this, is a skeleton which shows how to link a BÃ˜ client to the pre-defined tools in the Coppelia scene
 - Additional information such as tutorials for how the robot actuates, as well as other useful gems that help to better understand the project
